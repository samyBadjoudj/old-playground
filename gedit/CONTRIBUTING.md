How to contribute to gedit
==========================

gedit development relies on voluntary contributions and everyone is invited to
help.

If you are interested in helping us to improve gedit, please contact the
developers on IRC and/or send a message to the gedit mailing list and offer your
help. See the “Getting in Touch” section on the
[gedit wiki page](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit).

Contributions other than software development
---------------------------------------------

See the [GNOME wiki](https://wiki.gnome.org/).

Doing **bug triaging** on the bug tracker is a very useful task for gedit,
because gedit is used by many people and there are therefore lots of bug reports
or feature requests. The gedit developers often have difficulties to triage all
the bugs and do first line support. Having a curated list of important bugs to
fix would tremendously help the gedit developers.

Software development
--------------------

To get started with gedit software development, see the file
[docs/gedit-development-getting-started.md](docs/gedit-development-getting-started.md).

gedit follows the same guidelines and code conventions as GtkSourceView. See
the [GtkSourceView HACKING file](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtksourceview/blob/master/HACKING).

The gedit and gedit-plugins Git repositories are hosted on the GNOME GitLab
instance:
- [gedit on GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gedit)
- [gedit-plugins on GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gedit-plugins)
